# Fraud Detection on Credit Card Transaction
### Introduction
Fraud is a rising billion-dollar business. According to the PwC global economic crime survey of 2018, there are 49% of the 7,200 companies who participated had suffered fraud. Fraud could be complicated in the real world business, which means we need to spend a significant amount of time planning and preparing before we start to throw fancy machine learning algorithms on it.   
### Conclusion 
In this project, I performed EDA on a heavily imbalanced dataset with 284,807 transactions and compared 7 popular classification models for differnet business objectives. For more insights, please check my DataPrep python notebook listed above( if it is not loading well, please visit: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shiyueamy/Fraud-Transaction-Detection/blob/master/DataPrep_for_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)
Generally, please consider Random Forest for wider degree of comprehensiveness or Logistic Regression for a higher precision.
